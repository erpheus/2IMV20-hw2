There is no commuting to the east side, and the vast majority of projects are based here, so there are a lot of interesting challenges. Big, gnarly projects where you can really stretch yourself, and if you find one that you are passionate about, and which doesn't get killed out from under you, it can be great.","It is very, very clear that employees are not valued -- Amazon burns through employees faster than any organization I have worked for, and puts little or no effort into retention. Work-life balance is something that the employee has to regularly put their foot down to enforce.  High density seating means engineers in those areas are not going to get stuff done. It's stupid, not frugal.  Legacy projects are left running in production long after everyone who has worked on them has left the company, with some unfortunate saps having to prop them back up every time they get paged, but without the authority to fix them so they are stable, since the next big thing is way too important. Maintenance tasks are not rewarded.  The product definition for the next big thing will change incessantly until it is finally launched long after it was promised, and after a long death march, during which several key people will have quit in disgust, and a few more will have been reassigned to another project that they had no interest in, but which had a lot of people quit in disgust. Don't worry though, that just means more work for everyone else, and a shorter on call rotation. And a lot of time interviewing people to try to replace the people who left.  Managers routinely lie to higher ups about the status of projects, so it becomes a crisis when someone finally notices things aren't going to be delivered on time.  Infrastructure and build tools are poorly maintained -- the teams are perpetually understaffed, like the rest of the company, and it results in productivity losses across the company, greater than the cost of just fully staffing those teams.  Between poor project management, poor product design, operational burden from slowly collapsing systems and poor development tools, so much time is wasted that it would be funny if you didn't care.  Compensation is ok, mostly. There is no gift-matching, which surprised me until I realized that Amazon has never donated anything to the community. There are countless little stingy things that come under the name of frugal, but which are just demoralizingly stupid.  Employee reviews are a sad joke. Also, stack ranking encourages some teams to deliberately hire a few unqualified people as self-protection.","Focus more on employee retention -- get rid of the managers who burn through employees to the point where things aren't getting done.  Not having enough meeting rooms doesn't mean that people will cut back on the number of meetings. It just means those meetings are held at people's desks, which annoys everyone around them.  Also, add more bathrooms -- the developer floors are 90% men, so the bathrooms are overused and disgusting.

0.420647218345474,apple,"New York, NY"," Aug 30, 2016",Current Employee - At-Home Advisor,"Lots of Pros, and a few big Cons",Best benefits I've ever had of any job. And perks out the wazoo. Work culture is very liberal and laid back. Pay is very competitive for the industry.,"With so many things right with this company, it's extremely disheartening that there are also so many things wrongs.  1) Little opportunity for upward movement - Apple REALLY likes to encourage its workers with promises of career advancement. Unfortunately, and not until recently, any and all movement I've encountered in the last year and a half has been lateral. The reason for this is due to Apple's outsourcing of advisors to 3rd party call centers or ""vendors"". For this reason, Apple is no longer opening up additional management positions, which has lowered the ceiling pretty dramatically. This is a huge disappointment for those of us who have at the ""Management"" carrot dangled on a stick in front of us for 2+ years.  2) Metrics-based performance measurements - One of the metrics by which advisors are measured is 'Issue Resolution."" After troubleshooting with Applecare, a customer gets a survey asking if their issue was resolved. If they answer 'yes,' this is good. If they answer 'no,' then the advisor is penalized. The problem I have with this, as a measured metric, stems from the fact that there is no expectation that all issues will be resolved by the end of the first call, before the survey is sent out.  So even on issues where the resolution is not 100% in control by the advisor, advisors are still graded on it. This means that if a hardware repair is needed, the call isn't resolved on the phone, and yet the advisor still gets a survey where they are held accountable for the resolution. If the customer has to stop troubleshooting and resume at a later time due to time constraints or a prior obligation, they'll get the survey, and may answer 'no' to the issue resolution question, and the advisor will be punished. Some tasks take a long time to complete over the phone, and customers are asked to call back after a specific step is completed. Once again, issue is not yet resolved, and yet the customer receives the survey asking this question.  I am of the opinion that if there is so much as an INKLING of a possibility that the issue not being fully resolved before the first call, due to factors outside of the advisors' control, then the advisor simply should not be graded on it. It makes as much sense as penalizing a baseball team for missing a game due to inclement weather.  Too frequently do circumstances outside of the advisors control govern an issue's resolution, and yet advisors are held accountable to these factors. This is wrong. This is unethical. And honestly, I feel that this runs counter to the culture Apple boasts. Any grievances aired to upper management about this are met with suggestions of mental gymnastics to try and essentially convince the customer to answer 'yes' to it, even if the issue is not resolved. No effort has been made to really address this as a valid issue, and I do not anticipate that this will change in the future. This is a fundamental flaw, and it's the only major, significant gripe I have about Apple policies and procedures, as a big company.  How this punishment affects the advisor is addressed in my next item:  3) Schedule picks - Advisors get a new schedule every 90 days. This is done through a process by which an advisor 'bids' on their preferred schedule, from a list of available schedules. The list of schedule picks available to the advisor is governed by their aforementioned metrics (including the dreaded Issue Resolution metric). Those with the poorest metrics (whether in their control or not) are often left to pick the 'scrap' (minus the 's') schedules from the bottom of the barrel, schedules that have the advisor working the entire weekend, working until nearly midnight every night, working on holidays, etc. Given the fact that the metrics on which we are measured that determine our 'place in line' for a schedule pick are not entirely within our ability to control, this inevitably screws with the home lives of a lot of advisors. I've heard of parents being unable to take or pick their children up from daycare because of this, people unable to attend church functions, celebrate holidays with their families, etc. And on some occasions, even glitches on the back end have stuck advisors with terrible schedules, without so much as a word from upper management on addressing it. And the ways in which the different senior area managers address these issues is extremely inconsistent, and would benefit from some calibration.  Apple is a large enough company, at this point, with a large-enough employee base that it could very easily assign workable, manageable schedules to every person in every timezone in such a way that it does not negatively affect their home lives, and still ensure that all customers are taken care of in a timely fashion. It's 100% plausible. And doing so would further promote the progressive culture that Apple loves to boast. But alas, they will do nothing of the sort.  4) The customers - As is the case with any customer service job, the most stressful part, day-to-day, is the customers. Angry customers who won't think rationally. Customers who simply want someone to get in trouble. Customers who blame Apple for their inability to function in a world full of modern technology. Customers who refuse to acknowledge user-error. And they take it out on you. Working this job has shown me the worst of the worst in people, and I know it's affected me in a very negative way (so much that I sought therapy from depression/emotional exhaustion because of it). This isn't Apple's fault, but people should still know what they're getting into.  5) You will work on major holidays. At least you will be scheduled, and expected to be in your seat ready to work, before they say ""Ok, you can leave,"" after the first few hours on the clock. Every single major holiday, advisors are required to work, and are often dismissed early due to low call volume. Of course I love being dismissed early on holidays. What I don't love is the inability to make plans with family for holidays due to the requirement of working, despite knowing I'll be dismissed early. Just let us off. Apple customers can go a day without someone to yell at when they don't know how to use their device. They'll live.  6) The resources given to advisors to utilize while troubleshooting are often insufficient, often nonfunctional and broken, and the fat is constantly being trimmed from them to make the advisors' jobs that much more difficult. Despite this, we are still held to the almighty metrics.  For some, these complaints may be relatively minor, but for me, after working here for 4 years, I'm left disenfranchised, and often uninterested, and certainly no longer passionate, about the work I'm putting in. I no longer look forward to working each day. At that same time, I feel trapped, because I know I won't find another job with benefits and compensation nearly as competitive as Apple's. I guess that's corporate work life for you. The level of effort I put into my work has lowered drastically, and with the punishments in place and the lack of incentives for hard work, I don't anticipate a shift toward the positive in the foreseeable future. The benefits and perks are phenomenal, but at a primal level, the things that affect you emotional, day in and day out, are what impact you the most, and Apple has lots of 'areas of opportunity' to improve upon.","It's time to dump the antiquated metrics-based performance measures, and implement something more in-line with Apple's progressive culture. Stop punishing advisors for factors that are out of their sphere of influence.

Clothing retail chains do not reflect the type of environment that managers need to succeed with Apple.

Given the opportunity, I believe Apple would have been better off recycling its own employee potential, and should have given these folks an opportunity with other stores, or within their own store.  Honestly, I can point back to where Apple 'harvests' its management from, and its not usually from its own employees, but from other retail chains that can't touch the high bar to how amazing Apple retail really is. That is truly the darkside of some of these stores.","Give your employees a chance! Your employees are pooled from the cream of the crop, and they certainly are great folks who want to make Apple successful.

You can learn relevant product knowledge if you want to bootstrap something later on.","- Promotions solely based on something they like to call VISIBILITY. Useless projects get started all the time just to be cc'd on emails to Director-level and above. Those projects in most cases lead to nothing and don't produce ANY results at all, it is solely done for the purpose of being able to mention one's ""great"" initiative in the next performance review cycle. Another factor they promote on are several ""soft attributes"" which is a way for management to promote on subjectivity. - You are always told the company is a meritocracy eventho it is clearly not. This incongruent messaging compared to reality is extremely frustrating. It does not matter at all if you reach 100% of your target or 200%, what matters in the end is the above mentioned visibility. Another proof is that I heard managers say ""Oh, he has been here already for 2.5 years, we have to promote him now"" which is a joke and demotivating for high performing folks. - The metrics you are measured on in an Account Management role are only indirectly linked to revenue and are manipulated by the vast majority of reps once they have been on the job for a quarter and know the drill. Management knows this but does not care since they look good in front of their own bosses if the numbers look good. The best of the manipulators do not have to work at all to reach their targets. - Many of the middle managers are incompetent and have been stuck in their role for sometimes nearly a decade. There is no real willingness to achieve something great and make progress, but those people are just happy where they are in their career and spend their whole day wasting everyone's time in meetings or sending out useless emails. Very limited learning opportunity if you have a manager like this and very demotivating because no one wants to end up like them. However, there is the rare exception of a great manager. - Leadership cult, people of levels of director and above are worshipped through the entire organization and are treated like god's gift to everything. Some of them are admittedly great, some of them aren't. - Learning curve will be non-existent at the latest after 6 months and you will be doing the same day in day out. You can learn by yourself some new stuff with the great online training database, but the main thing you are doing gets old quite soon. - A lot of people drink the kool aid. There are quite a few critical people like myself in the organization, but a majority of people think they are on top of the world because they work in one of the least respected role of a prestigious company. People are not ""super smart"" everywhere, they hire basically everyone and it is just luck getting through the interview process. 90%+ of hires come from personal referrals since their CVs wouldn't go through the official channel. Level of entitled and incompetent people can be extremely high in certain teams.","Get rid of some of the terrible sales team managers. Rethink the entire system of productivity metrics (Apollo made it easier for smart people to manipulate everything, it is a complete joke and demotivating to honest reps. The idea behind it is good, but the execution couldn't have been worse, no matter how much it has been promoted as a great thing by the leadership).

I brought this to management who sent me to upper management and still declined my request. It's suppose to go with who's been there the longest to which I was over the many.  Besides this, the pay was crap for the job. I've heard they've since upped the pay, but I suppose they had to as the turnover is ridiculously high. They are nonstop hiring.

Truly invest in transparent communication, because far too often it is the opposite. Amazon is a company that is in transition- it is getting bigger and bigger, and isn't scaling effectively in many areas, especially people management. While Amazon has long prided itself on being agile and not stuck in its ways, it has taken change for change's sake to the extreme. It's wearing on employee morale, and there has been a distinct loss of vision. Long time employees with great knowledge, ambition, and a passion for what they do are leaving in droves because the negativity and loss of balance with home/family are becoming too much to bear. In my last year with Amazon, there was a lot of discussion about remedying those, assurances that VP's/SVP's cared about those long-time people and retaining them. And it was just talk- no planning, no action, no actual analysis to see what could be done to boost morale and therefore productivity/innovation. Due to the type of job I held, I had contacts with dozens of departments- and the story was always the same. Disengaged or openly hostile leadership. Loss of vision/focus. Burned out people leaving. I still believe Amazon offers a fantastic opportunity and has many wonderful services and products to offer. Until they start to take seriously the loss of good people and the reputation they are acquiring, a downward trend seems inevitable.

Very hot and dusty environment. Allowed 30 mins. for lunch and two 15 min. breaks for a 10 hr. shift, but that means simply away from your station and or scanning. It takes several minutes to get to the break room and to get back to floor, so it's really a 20ish minute lunch and 10 minute (at best) breaks. If you go to the bathroom during work hours you are ""off task"" and can get in trouble and the few minutes going to the restroom greatly impacts your rate. Your rate drops every second you are not slaving away.  Amazon claims the customer is the most important thing, but its seems rates are. I do make rate regularly, mostly well over 100%, but it's very difficult, PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTING. Such high rates, 10 hrs a day, 4 to 6 days a week on a concrete floor are physically very demanding and not very safe.  Quite a few people cut corners, the cherry pick and pass harder work to others and management doesn't do anything about it. Quality is overlooked for the sake of speed. Customers will get damaged goods or the wrong product, but they'd rather get the item out than ensure that it's in good condition and or the right item. I've seen many damaged items get passed down to the next step and the next, because it would take time to fix the problem. A lot of people just pass it down, instead of dealing with it. Or they damage it themselves in their haste and pass it on. The lazy ones who pass the buck and the cherry pickers make work much harder, and negatively impact the rates, for us with a good work ethic and who care about the customer.  No real opportunities to move up from warehouse associate. Can't move to another department, even if you're cross-trained without applying and interviewing as if you were a brand new associate. There are no such things as promotions at Amazon. Raises are a joke, 25 cents every six months, and not merit based.  Favoritism - some employees, who are friends of supervisors, or PAs at Amazon, are allowed to get away with hardly working and talking for a good part of the day and are given tasks that are easy and tasks that others would like to do (water spider for example), but they slack most of the time.

He spent $20 mil per year on some equipments which melt down network connectivity so many times every month. He claimed that the equipments would save Google for 10 millions per year, but in fact, we spent a lot more work hours on trying to solve the problems these junks caused. The main problem is, there is no test base for these junks. Aren't we supposed to test all the equipment before we implement or even purchase them? Not these junks... how does it happen? pick ur guess! How about we go the manger above him. Too bad.. the upper manager is his buddy. There is no complain or any bad thing would ever leak out through these 2 layers of managers. They cover everything up very well. In fact, one of the manager's jobs should ensure the fairness. Well... ""fairness"" is NEVER been seen at this team.  2. politics tricks My manager has this policy: all the engineers under level III can not talk to the engineers above level IV. Well.... before I join google, I thought anyone could talk directly to anyone, even to CEO. But my manager fired a person who asked questions to a level IV. His recently move was - promoted two of his favorites to be managers and directly reported to him. You know what it means? He just promoted himself since there are two managers reporting to him now. That was the exact trick his upper manager did a couple years ago. Now... there are 3 levels of management under one director. How does this director allow this happen?? well.. that's the politics. So, when the new engineer join the team, how many levels above him?? It's IMPOSSIBLE that you get promoted if there is one new layer added. Most likely, you got downgraded every year!!  3. STEALING/CHEATING I've never seen so many cheating cases ever since I graduated from college, but here, at Google. We have two level IV engineers responsible for designing networks with one stealing ideas/credits from the other one's work!! And this cheating is permitted by the upper manager!! How did it happen? well... the managers playing the games. The two (now three) levels managers ensures that none of outside team could work with the talent engineer alone. When they steals, those seniors all lined up and the upper manager would give pressure down to turn in the design and the credits. Whoever on the same side of this level IV engineer would suffer a hard time and have bad reviews from those managers. So, we watched the stealing and cheating happening every day but no one dare to say anything.  <to be continued>","I thought Google was not a place for the politician to play games with every day.

Employees were terrified of making mistakes. There were rumours that some employees were let go just because they had some mistakes in their quality. This is not right. People make mistakes and should be given the opportunity to learn from them.  Every minute of your day is counted. You get 30 minutes for lunch and 2 15 minute breaks. If you exceed your break time you will get an email saying you exceeded it. Meeting time is also very strict and managers seem to be terrified of going over time. For example when our team had 15 minutes allocated for meeting time once the 15 minutes were up our manager told us to quickly get back to our desks and change back to available. There is no flexibility whatsoever.  There are no public holidays for Cork office. You are even expected to work on Christmas day.  Communication in the company is very poor. Things are constantly changing but employees are never really given reasons for the changes. They are just told that's the way it is now.  The office environment isn't very nice. There are very few windows and hardly any natural light. The fluorescent lights are very harsh.  I felt like teamwork wasn't really encouraged. Everybody was too worried about their own IPH (investigations per hour) and couldn't really take time to help others (Even though most people were very nice and would have liked to help others) . I feel this is a very individualistic culture (typical American culture).,"Have you heard of the psychological contract? Basically it means if you treat employees well, respect them, trust them, etc. they will respect you, trust you and be motivated to work hard. I felt like the psychological contract in Amazon was very poor. The way everything is micro-managed makes employees feel like they are not trusted. Some flexibility surrounding time would be nice.  Adapt to the local Irish/ European culture. I feel the culture is too American (i.e. the individualistic culture mentioned in cons). Irish/ European culture is more relaxed/ sociable.  Let employees know it's OK to make mistakes sometimes as long as they learn from them. Change the culture of fear to a culture of support.  Improve communication.

0.172888921826067,apple,none," Mar 16, 2018",Former Employee - Apple At Home Advisor,Poor Experience,I really can't find any.,"I cannot recommend anybody to work at Apple whether as an Apple Home Advisor or working in Cork in Customer Service. Many things went wrong for me there. Below is the list:  - I was confirmed that I was hired by mail, then I was highly praised by the recruiter on the phone for that (it really sounded like fake congrats to me). I was told I would be contacted in the next 2 days. I got no news for 3 weeks. I kept calling and I could only reach the voice mail. Then when I wrote an email, I was told I should contact another contact person which I did. The new person in charge of my integration apologized. I didn’t know at that time it would not be the only problem I would have with Apple.  - Then came the equipment delivery story. As I wanted to take holidays before starting I wanted to know when the equipment would be delivered. I always got vague answers per mail like “we will send it next week” without further information. The problem in the company is that the recruiters (except the Recruitment Managers) calls with concealed numbers so you cannot reach them on the phone.  - Then, only a couple of days before starting the job I was asked if I could work with German language instead of French as they had a big need for German speakers. I refused as I started to be pissed with the lack of professionalism there.  - When I started there, even if I hadn’t high expectations, I could not expect that I would have such social outcasts for colleagues. I know how bad it is to talk badly about colleagues, I don’t like that, but it is good to know with whom you will potentially work if you take the job. In our team, one third of the team were very fat people (I do not make fun of them), one third are poor geeks crazy about Apple and other people who just look suspicious when you see them on camera (some appear with hoods, or other just refuse to appear on camera, etc). You just have the feeling that they decided to work from home to hide from the outside world. Most of them made me feel quite uncomfortable sometimes. We were trained by colleagues and managers based at Cork office, they were just like the same I had for colleagues (see above), people who have been living in Ireland over 6 years and who still speak an awful English…  - It is also important to mention that the job itself is completely uninteresting, extremely repetitive and that you do not have any leeway. Everything is scripted. We are quite far from the so-called creativity touted by Apple. This is just fiction.  - Then came the payslips problem. At Apple you are paid monthly. I was not paid for 2 months, yes it is! And it seems it happens sometimes there, so be prepared if you go there, get enough savings or you may end up on the streets!  The reason why I was not paid on time was because I entered the bank details too late. That was the first explanation from a not nice guy from HR which refused to give his first name that I asked only for a follow-up and not for complaining about him... Calling a second time I was informed that “Too late” meant that I entered the bank details only 1 month before due date… Yes, 1 month is not enough… They recognized that it was not normal, they apologized, they told me they would investigate blablabla… All this is not really serious but nothing is really taken seriously at Apple it seems.  - I was paid on Emergency Tax because I did not enter the PPS number in the proper format. I was informed about it but I could not get a fix about what the proper format is, nobody could tell me even when I was still working there. Nobody thinks outside the box. Scripts. Scripts. Scripts...  - Otherwise, I am still struggling to get all my money back and it takes a lot of effort calling Revenue to explain them that weird case.  The problem with Apple is that they are based in Cork and not so many people want to go there, so they have to go with what they can get.  Some bad reviews disappeared since when I saw them before applying for Apple at Home Advisor. I cannot say why. However, many companies in Ireland ask their employees to make nice reviews on Glassdoor so...

It can be confusing and stressful to work there.

0.328353824438381,amazon,"Seattle, WA"," Aug 8, 2010",Current Employee - Software Development Engineer II,Loose Federation of Small Interdependent Teams Working on Diverse Projects,"After working as a college intern at the company I was offered a full-time position which I accepted. As a first-time job out of college I can't recommend it enough, just make sure you're on a team working on an unreleased product. An Amazon team in heads-down development mode is an amazingly productive and inventive thing. Projects are rapidly prototyped, torn down, and built anew. The build system is bar none the best I have ever used, if you need some library to do something, you just depend on it. Done.  We had a senior principal engineer acting as a sort of roaming quarterback among our teams and he frequently sat in on design brainstorming sessions. He also sat ten feet away from me, so bouncing ideas off of him was frictionless and really helped me grow as a fault-tolerant systems architect.  People wear many hats at Amazon and you can quickly make a name for yourself as ""the X guy"" if you devote yourself to being an expert in X. Plans change and you can get a golden opportunity in your lap if you're lucky. For me it was defending our system architecture against three senior principals. Get your name out there and you'll have other (potentially cooler) teams trying to headhunt you from your current one. I would recommend this strategy: stay on a project long enough to make a name for yourself in some way and then jump ship to another team. A year and a half to two years is a good periodicity for this process.  The best thing about Amazon is that if you find yourself getting tired of the same old drag in your current position, you can jump ship to another team and work on something entirely new and exciting. This is not Microsoft: there is little animosity between teams and no hard feelings will be had. You can be writing servers in Java one year, virtualization modifications to the Linux kernel the next, and messaging systems in Erlang the next.  Corporate culture is good. There aren't as many hokey ice-breaker or get-to-know-each-other events as in other companies. I once heard the company described as ""having a good drinking culture,"" which certainly was true within my team. Our outings were more like pub crawls, with pool and bowling often thrown in as an afterthought as we wandered around Capitol Hill. Good times were had.  The pay is pretty good too and I hear the stock ain't doing half bad, too.  In summary, I wholeheartedly endorse Amazon as a first out-of-college job for people who want to learn a lot about anything. Just don't dig down too much in one team and you can rise to prominence in any area you want. Within a year I was designing and implementing key pieces of our architecture and my ideas and proposals were taken as seriously as those from people with a decade or more with the company.","N.B.—My team probably ranked in the top five for pager pain metrics. I've seen the histograms, and there is a long tail. You'll likely find yourself in a team with far less pager pain, but be warned that it can be bad.  Yes, you have to carry a pager. Yes, it can be hell. You will invariably try to go to a pub one hour before your rotation ends only to be paged into an event that requires a conference call with multiple VPs and on-edge datacenter engineers. You may go to bed at 1 AM Sunday night, be paged at 5 AM Monday morning and not stop firefighting until 2 AM Tuesday. It can be draining.  People say Amazon never ships a version two of anything, and I think this is the reason why. Asking your educated thought workers to sit around doing menial ""keep the stack running"" tasks can be a pain, and the small team sizes are great and all, but you'll find yourself wishing for more people to share the pager pain, misery loves company.  At one point my project entered a dark phase in which all feature development tasks were superseded by the need to just keep the service up and running. Hacks and kludges were put in place to reduce the load and extreme measures were taken to keep us up and running. In retrospect, our project was characteristically different from other web services and this sort of thing was predictable, but we didn't get ahead of the problem quickly enough. One tends to blame management when these things happen, saying ""we'll take the technical debt and put it on the backlog for now"" one too many times can result in one hell of a lot of interest to pay off.  The whole period seemed like hell when it was happening, a team member switched teams, the intern went back to college, the managers did a nice little switcharoo, we had three developers to actually code. But it passed. And I got an offer with another team with essentially no oncall rotation and whose work I really admired. I didn't take it because I knew I'd soon leave the company due to a cross-country move (I didn't want to join a brand new team for only two months), but the thought crossed my mind.  So if you have a needy family, enjoy sleeping, or can't bear the thought of a pager, maybe Amazon is not for you. If you're willing to look past that in order to work at a company that actually ships products (rather than having them always in beta or research), I say the pain outweighs the gain.","Being second to market is not always the end of the world. Ship early, ship often is fine, but when crucial flaws are found putting band-aids over them and saying ""we'll take the debt"" is not a good solution. We don't have anyone nearby in the web services category and I'd rather see things ship perfect than them ship first and have terrible performance issues.  But I'm not a manger and I'm not a businessman. Perhaps the added personnel and hardware and emotional costs are eventually overcome by all the cash that comes in.",4,3.5,none,4,5,4,28,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Amazon-Reviews-E6036_P1711.htm

No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.  2. What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations. If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher. 401k match is nice.  3. Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine. This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs. The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either. You'll get a bonus each year and some stock. It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.","Brand on Your Resume: After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.  Managing Your Career: Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there. Double that for vendors. It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company. Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too. Not familiar with the stack rank? Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade"".","I'll type it here - but I don't they are listening... 1. Help proven talent move laterally in the company for new opportunities. 2. Kill/evolve the stack rank. Here's basically how it's viewed:. 30% of the company gets 1s and 2s - and they are happy. 50% get 3s and that basically feels like getting a ""C"" in school. This sucks for talented people when a multitude of UNCONTROLLABLE conditions keep you from getting into 1 or 2 range. The 20% getting anything below a 3 are walking dead. In summary, 70% of the company walk away from the review cycle feeling like crap. This is no good.  After 10 years, I'm leaving - it's just a matter of time until I find the right opportunity. I need to find a company spends 90% of it's time building technology experiences, as opposed to 90% of its time building PowerPoints.

Altho, I hear this is changing and Netflix will only give you a raise if you can find someone in the Bay Area with the exact title and responsibilities who make more. Contrary to the buzz about Netflix being a tech innovator, it's become a ""Hollywood"" company. What drives Netflix is the Netflix ""produced"" shows, not the ""innovative"" streaming technology - Hollywood runs Netflix, not Los Gatos.","Since many people are only at Netflix for the higher than average salary, there is a culture of fear whereby people are constantly worried about their employment status in the company and will, unfortunately, submit to their baser instincts to do whatever it takes to keep their job.

Cool techie environment. Learn the latest and greatest in the tech world as it develops.","-Biggest problem at Google = poor managers who lack leadership skills. My manager never once created an annual or quarterly strategic business plan. He (actually *I*) filled in the template given by management, but he never created a plan we could work toward. As a result, people did what they wanted, which was not always most profitable (in part because short term incentives don't align with long term profitability). This created a lot of problems. In 2007, the company created a new layer of middle-manager jobs and hired people internally...without training them to be managers! Disaster. Lots of inefficiency and broken promises. Horrible decision that continues to plague employees. There are some good managers, I just didn't work with any. -No career development. Minimal worthwhile training. You can take a course here and there, but when it comes to moving around the company, watch out. Sales, Engineering, and Enterprise are silos---you can't move between them. *Everyone* complains about this. Smart people have for years been talking about leaving. -They fired most of HR in 2009 (the others have always been contract workers without benefits), what remains of HR is really weak. HR is never helpful anyway. -No one ""owns"" decisions (not even managers or their managers!), but everyone gets a say...so few risks get taken and greatness rarely evolves beyond the idea stage -There's a lot of mediocrity, why improve when improvement might require you or teammates to work a little smarter or harder? Lots of resistance to change that requires more work. -Flat organization is bad for people whose work shows skill beyond job level / area & typical promotion cycles (senior management encouraged national sales team to think of lateral moves as promotions...even though you don't make more money, get better titles--and then must start the promotion journey afresh as if you had never worked there before) -Salary. When Google offered me the job, a well-known, respected web property with a similar job did as well. The latter offered me TWICE as much money as Google. Twice! And all the good benefits. -Salary increases over time. When you're promoted, you don't make all that much more. Bonuses are small (and taxed at 50%). Options are not worth as much as you think. And you don't get as much stock as you think, either. (These are taxed at 50%, too, so you don't really get very much!)  All of this relates to the non-engineering side. I always really liked the engineers and when I worked with their projects found great synergies. Unfortunate the sales side made it so hard to move over!","Teams need better direction. Many managers are very poor leaders who don't make decisions or set clear goals or make teammates accountable to those goals. Just letting everyone do their own thing is a problem...especially when multiple positions have to support multiple people whose own agendas create conflicts of interest (and inefficiencies and tension). You need to give stars more opportunity to grow, they need more than just new projects. You need to actually develop these people.

0.190418816094744,microsoft,"Redmond, WA"," Jul 8, 2015",Current Employee - Senior Product Manager,The ,The benefits with the exception of the health insurance are good. The health insurance in the worst in the industry from what used to be the best. Salary is decent,"Health Insurance: This benefit went from having zero premiums, zero co-pay and zero deductible to having a $3700 deductible for a family plan and then after paying 20%. Then to make matters worst they have added a very complicated and administrative intensive HSA to manage all of this. Your wife will not have access as it is tied to your corp account so you will have to manage it if you are used to your wife managing these types of things  Expectations: The unspoken expectation is that you change jobs every 3 years or you are viewed as being dead weight. It is exhausting. So if you find a job you love and you are really really good at, you simply have to leave. Could this be the reasons our products keep getting worse? Because the people who know them have to leave whether they want to or not?  Stack Ranking: Do not believe the hype. This still exists. They just call it something else and it is more secretive  Review System: Instead of 2 reviews per year there are a minimum of 4 But they are called Connects now. You only get compensation for one. So they made something that was already a hassle and made it a double hassle. Everything you do has to have an immediate business impact. So if you have a long term strategy or even short term, say a year, nothing you do towards achieving that goal counts because it does not have immediate ""business impact"". This all started under Satya  Middle Managers: When Satya came onboard there was all this talk of getting rid of layers of middle management so the real ideas could get to the people who needed to hear them. This never happened. Every layoff or RIF, Middle Mgrs. were not impacted and well known technical resources were let go. This is a company that values non-technical business school managers more than technical people. Very different than when I started and the reverse was true  Promotions: You do not get promoted to a new job. You only get promoted within your current job. Being promoted is actually a negative within MS. For example, If your job level ranges from 50-52 (fictitious levels). Say you got promoted mid year from a 50 to a 51. You think great I am doing a good job! Then come review time you get a mediocre review. Why you ask? I am doing the same work I was before, same job. Management will tell you that now you are being reviewed and compared against others at level 51 so more is expected of you. Promotions can be used as a way to phase you out. If they want you gone they can promote you to level 52 so now you either have to transfer or end up with poor reviews at the higher level. I have known people who moved to jobs at a lower level so they had room to grow. Most people don't want to reach the dreaded level 63 or 64 I think which is where ALOT more is expected of you.  Outside Redmond: If you do not live in Redmond there are very few opportunities. Remember the move every 3 years, Do the math  Work Life Balance: This does not exist. You will be expected to work/check email on vacations, holidays etc. And respond. I will say that they are flexible about things like leaving early to go to a parent/teacher meeting and things like that. But you will work 60+ hours per week and be connected to email 24/7. They do lots of lip service about how this will change but in the 10 plus years I have worked year it has not. The trick is to take the popular vacations Christmas, July 4th, then everyone else is on vacation so you might not be bothered  Company/Product Info: If you think you will have access to new products, think again. You will have access when the public does. You will find out info when the public does. External customers such as TAP will know before you do. Mary Jo Foley will know before you do. This applies to internal changes in upper management. A memo goes out to the press the same time you receive it. There is no level of trust. There is also no internal system to share your ideas for product improvement. There sort of is, but it really goes into a black hole  Email Alias Nitemare: Want to talk to a real person about a problem you are having with an internal tool? Good luck. You will have to send email to an alias and they will respond within 48 hours. Call the Help Desk? Our Help Desk (the majority) is in India in case you are wondering. Want to get a question answered about Benefits? Again send email to an alias and wait 48 hours.  Cost Center: Do not work for a cost center. Make sure you work for a Product Team or revenue generating team. If you work in a Cost Center they are always nickel and diming and it gets worse every year. Work for a Product Team, especially one that is profitable and the champagne and caviar are flowing. I could not believe the difference.  There are too many temps or contingent staff. In my opinion it is just odd. And they have important jobs and get treated like full time employees. Until their contract is up and they have to leave.  Diversity: If you are a white male look elsewhere. This company is all about hiring females and non-white employees for the sake of diversity. Ironically there are very few African Americans here but people of other ethnicities  Change for the sake of change: Each fiscal year the manager's come out with their plans. Everyone throws their all into it, then come June it does not matter because the fiscal year starts July 1st and everything changes. Even if managers were on the right course they MUST change for the mere sake of change or they look like dead weight. Don't our products do that too?  Summary: If you are a student or technical rockstar looking for a home, this is not it. This is a large corporation with all the politics that go with it and then some more BS specific to this company alone. There are plenty of other options out there if you are gifted our just starting out. The health insurance when it was good used to keep people here, not anymore. I am waiting for some stock to vest and then I am looking for other opportunities",Managers are a dime a dozen. You cannot be half a tech company. Instead of laying off your tech people it is time to get rid of middle managers who are not contributing anything to the bottom line and keep the people of real value or another company will be glad to have them.

0.339768782892932,amazon,"San Jose, CA"," Aug 30, 2018",Current Employee - Senior Learning and Talent Development Specialist,There is not a single company in the world that I would rather work for!,"The Amazon corporate culture/values are the best in the world. We obsess over customers. Some companies claim to care about customers, but from my experience working in retail management for other companies what they do does not even come close to what Amazon does.  We pioneer, innovate, and value the opinions of employees and customers at all levels . We truly listen to both customers and employees. I have personally worked on many initiatives to put Associate feedback into action. Some of the best ideas come from our front line employees. We listen to their feedback about barriers they face and improvements that can be made to make their job easier or better and we take action to improve those things quickly! This includes anything from adding more food options in the breakroom to making multi-million dollar investments into new technology, equipment, process improvements, etc.  The career opportunities are virtually limitless. While I was a leader in Operations within the Fulfillment Centers I personally reviewed resumes, helped with interview prep, provided opportunities for Associates to take on new and challenging roles, and personally promoted over 30 well deserving Associates from front line employees into Management positions in a span of only about 2-3 years.  Within my own career I have had an opportunity to run a department/area within a Fulfillment Center as an Area Manager where I was able to directly support, train, and mentor a large team of Associates.  I was then able to transition into an ACES Continuous Improvement Manager role where I received expert level training, development, and experience on Lean Six Sigma process improvement strategies equivalent to that of a Black Belt.  I got promoted into a Operations Manager role where I was managing other Operations Area Managers and leading a very large team of Associates in a Fulfillment Center.  I was even able to participate in an innovative new rotational program where my only job was to listen to the needs of both Associates and Managers and ensure that their feedback for improvements got put into action as quickly as possible. We call this Voices in Action. This included anything from adding better flavors of creamer for the free coffee, to adding more fans for better airflow in specific hot spots in the FC, to providing career skills training to Associates wanting to promote and grow in their careers, to providing mentorship and development training to new managers still learning how to be great leaders. The fact that Amazon would invest so much into supporting its employees speaks volumes to the culture of the company and that they are not just talking the talk they are walking the walk.  Through my experiences within Operations I wanted to make a bigger impact on the way the we onboard, train, and continuously develop employees at all levels of the organization. So I was able to transfer into a new role where I am now a part of the North American Learning and Talent Development Team that continues relentlessly to improve every aspect of how we setup new and existing Amazonians for success in their career. I am empowered and encouraged to try new ideas, solve problems, collaborate with other teams, innovate on behalf of both internal and external customers and I love what I do!  I also get the opportunity to work with some of the most intelligent, talented, and motivated people on the planet with a huge amount of diversity, which just further adds to the quality of work that we do as a team and how well we are able to serve our customers and fellow Amazonians.  I even helped a member of my family get a job here through a job recommendation because I knew he would love it too!","We provide stock to all Amazon employees at all job levels. The stock was somewhere around $340 a share when I joined about 4 years ago. Now it is almost $2,000 a share and just keeps going up! The only hard thing about that is not know when or if you should ever sell it. Amazon wants all of its employees to feel personally invested in the success of the company and they do this by making everyone an Owner both figuratively and literally with stock. It feels great to know that the value we add to the company through our everyday work also gets rewarded through out ownership in Amazon stock.","If you ever find yourself in a role that does not feel like the right long-term fit you can always look for other opportunities within Amazon through internal transfers. I know a lot of people that have very successfully made changes in their career path from Operations, to HR, or Continuous Improvement, or Learning/Training and Development, or Finance, or Safety, or Maintenance Engineering, etc. The opportunities at Amazon to continue to grow, learn new skills, and explore new opportunities are very common, and the options are virtually limitless.",5,5,5,5,5,5,0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Amazon-Reviews-E6036_P121.htm

After that, you start to get a better handle on things.","I haven't been with Amazon for a long time and I do have the chance to work with an extraordinary manager who is just supportive, encouraging and always guiding you wherever she thinks she can.

The company moves slower than ALL competitors. We are too afraid of failure so we take no risks. That's an unsustainable market position even if Office 365 prints money or Exchange is forced down the throats of all the Fortune 500 companies' employees. Soon enough it will be leap frogged by the next wave small businesses using newer products and processes. There is very little genuine innovation. Too many broken promises Windows 8, Surface, Windows Phone, Zune, Xbox music, Bing, Nokia etc. We enter markets without passion. It just seems like someone in management said, ""Here's a place we might be able to make some money."" Then we timidly go into the market and kill the project a few years later. The products lack fundamentals, passion and focus because leadership lacked a focus on the fundamentals and genuine passion for the customer's needs. There is no real feedback loop between putting a product out and seeing if it's successful and iterating. Usually we take so long to make something that a feedback look is years then people have moved on to other projects and a different team has to pick up the pieces and start over only to make the same mistakes.

I've seen a lot of other companies from the outside, as a former strategy consultant, and Google's more extraordinary than a lot of those on the inside realise. The culture's very transparent (though that may reflect function / geography) and impressively flat. Which isn't to say there aren't title and salary differences, but that fantastic people with lowly titles are given the space and encouragement to do fantastic things.","As the organisation grows, the 'flatness' of it makes it pretty exhausting: there are too many other people and functions to deal with, and very little opportunity to delegate responsibility. A corollary of is that you're valued and recognised in proportion to how you're viewed by those many other people, which favours those who're noisiest. Self-promotion and internal marketing for yourself and your projects is (usually) something you need to take time over if you're going to do well here, and that's a pity because it's mostly unproductive - in the sense that the company or the projects don't improve much for you shouting about them.","There's been a lot of work, this calendar year, on improving internal mobility between roles and functions and that's admirable. Now that horizontal mobility's being addressed properly, it's time for a fresh look at vertical mobility. It's not an easy problem: it's very difficult to combine what's best about the culture (that it's flat and that people are not micro-managed, at least in Marketing / Product / Eng) with highly-objective and insightful reviews by managers: those managers just don't have enough data to go on. But it still feels like there's improvement potential here. Another, unrelated suggestion: the free-wheeling, bottom-up approach to product strategy and prioritisation we have isn't cutting it any more. There are fundamental issues with a lot of the products we're hoping to make money out of or drive adoption for, and those issues are being addressed too slowly. We're betting too generously on too many products, as well.  For all the whingeing, though, senior management are very impressive and really care about making it a good place.

I didn't really like the perspective of remote work from Canada for around 2 years so eventually I declined the offer.

Ownership is a real thing, not just management-speak. Every SDE gets to own the entire service/product and has insight and input into every step - requirements gathering, design, development, deploy and maintainance. This is particularly true in new or relatively young services. Each service is also independent of each other. In most aspects, this leads to a startup culture within the big organization. At the same time, being a large organization allows great shared platforms and technologies to be used by all the mini-startups within the company.","Lots of management hires from outside the company recently, a recent trend is to crowd out engineers out of meetings. Not sure how it is going to impact the culture long term.  Another big con is the compensation. Performance reviews and compensation revisions don't go hand-in-hand. Compensation change follows a really opaque process, with the end result being most pay hikes are paltry, even with great perf review scores. Only saving grace is the stock grant you get on joining and vests over 4 years. That is why so many people leave after 4 years - there is big drop in effective comp at the end of 4 years. In short, if you are joining Amazon, remember that you are basically negotiating salary for 4 years, not just the first year.","Beware of 'death by commitee'- too many managers kill a product, not allow it to focus on customers.

Many managers are ill-trained or have never held or been mentored as ""people managers"" so are not truly savvy enough to grow their employees. They tend to ""game"" the system to promote themselves by taking credit for others' work, focusing on ""hiring"" senior level employees vs. developing junior employees into senior roles (as that's hard due to the HR process), and invest more of their time in empire building (e.g. if you're an L6 manager, you'd progress faster to L7 if you have more L6s reporting to you...so you hire from outside by creating new positions vs. promoting from within). This is one of the biggest concerns many employees have (and many leave due to this) that it's easier to come in at a higher level with a fancy resume (e.g. VP tile at a 10-person startup can come into a level higher than someone operating already at that level without title) and successfully navigating 1-day of 5-6 45-min interviews. And managers can set up the loop to their advantage by picking the bar raiser they align with, or picking the people for the loop who they know would favor hiring that employee, etc. However, an employee with credible tenure and documented success wouldn't even be allowed to apply (managers actually select who can apply) be hired into a higher position by design. Which explains the ""Hire and Develop"" the best value, and not ""Develop and Hire"" the best. It's very common to see people getting promoted who are in close proximity to HQ or senior leaders. - You rarely see HR business partners anywhere, you'd be lucky if you even know you HR BP's name after 4 yrs!

You get bonuses, perks and more incentives for job well done. You can be cross trained in various departments. They provide career course training. Also after one year they will pay for you to go to school.","You never can speak to a live person from your personal site from HR by phone. Which is horrible if you have an urgent need. Everything with them is done via chat or calling some 1800 number and escalating calls for 24-48hrs to get back to you on matters, which they never can give direct answers or are never of much help, and when they finally do get back to you it's via email. Feels like when you're dealing with the cable people or some other order service by phone and talking to foreigners. When you just want to speak with someone who knows what's going on and will resolve. Another with being hired you're going in blind sided, they don't tell you what department you're working in, all the way up to you start work trying to know department and all between live chat and calling the ERC they claim to not know your department you'll be in which is a lie they can find out and do know. You're giving one shift and than they randomly change it, never mind if you changed your life around based on the already assigned schedule. They say oh no worries you'll find out when you're there and if a problem they can change it just talk to HR if any problems. But they may just have to change your start date unless they can fit you in on that shift. However, once there they have a very nasty disposition and say well we can Change your department at will based on business needs which is crap. So trying to find every way to mediate the issue where we can all be happy is not in there interests. The company claims to care about their workers but they do not. They attitude was basically this is your shift NOW and department you can't change it until after 90days. Which is also false because they will try any and everything to avoid you from switching departments. When you start you don't find out your position until 4hrs in to the shift what department you will be in. But they simply force your hand leaving you with no choice but to quit call out or use your personal time, even if it was there error. Truth be told that's why it's such a high turnover they under pay for what they expect the employees to do, and they're nasty. The way they work with picking is not productive rather counterproductive. Just horrible","Treat your employees better. If you want all this high demanding work pay more money. The key is work smart not harder, LISTEN to your employees find way to implement new ideas in still expanding and expediting orders yet in a more logical and functional way for instance either have pickers for each floor or make the picks go in order not jumping from floor one to three next pick common sense you'll tire out much faster. Get more forklifts and provide training from employees already licensed. That will help alleviate issues and make orders go out much faster. At each site location there needs to be an actual active Human resource room and phone number even for managers for proper communication. Finally be mor honest upright and forthcoming with employees on what positions are available or they are being hired for before they accept making them feel taken or trapped tricked. Let them have the option to say okay that position is fine I'll accept. But lying and not willing to fix will always leave to high turnover. If these could be fixed I'm sure the company and its employees will be more happy and eager to stay!",1,1,1,2,1,1,0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Amazon-Reviews-E6036_P707.htm

0.998639506834238,amazon,"Seattle, WA"," Mar 10, 2016",Current Employee - Senior Manager,Transformational career experience - Amazon Web Services,"Working for AWS has been the highlight of my career thus far. I've spent more than 4 years at the company - with a short break in the middle. So many learning opportunities in this company and opportunities to make a difference at all levels. Despite being a larger company there is plenty of chance to be impactful whether you're in the field, in engineering, or sales and marketing roles. The rate of change in the business has been exponential over these past years and being part of that growth has been eye opening. The company tends to be pretty flat and really live its leadership principles. It's a very common theme for people to think they're just put up on a wall for people to read - but they're not - they really are interwoven into everything that people do. The customer obsession vs. competitor obsession is refreshing to someone like me who has spent a bunch of time in the tech industry. A generally humble company which is always looking to improve and do the right thing for customers. Also like the fact that nothing is beneath people in the company - a stark difference to other companies where ""execs"" are considered unapproachable and aloof. Most approachable group of senior execs I have ever encountered. When I left AWS I missed it intensely and was pleased to return. I think it's a transformational environment and one that changes you and has developed and improved me to a pretty incredible degree. Very lucky to have had a lot of the experiences that I have had.","Delivering and insisting on the highest standards is not for everyone. If you're working on product launches and it becomes crunch time then you are likely to be working harder than a regular 9-5 job. With that said, though, I've got many friends who manage a good work life balance. Some roles make that easier than others so it's worth choosing wisely. Amazon isn't a company that coddles its employees though...so if you want the chef prepared free food, and massages at your desk, then this isn't the place for you. It's also not particularly structured for career development. Both of these things aren't particularly important to me - I roll my eyes a little at the over-the-top perks I see in the valley and the approach to career development here completely suits me - but it requires you to be comfortable being a self-starter and to deal with ambiguity.

I also witnessed racial discrimination.  When I pointed out an architectural flaw in the system, I was called a drama queen and ignored, until the system self-imploded from said flaw a few months later (of course I got no credit from pointing it out). I was never invited to team events and was blatantly told it was because I was a girl by other team members. I was the only female engineer on the team. My manager though topics like strippers was perfectly OK work conversation.  As for hearing loss discrimination, it got progressively worse over time. People joked about me to ""not tell me to do something, I'd just hear it wrong."" This grew to being told not to talk in meetings, not being invited to meetings, and being told not to answer anything verbally - the only thing I was told I was allowed to verbally say is ""I'll get back to you with that"" and answer via e-mail. I was also told I was only allowed to answer e-mails in one or two sentences. Then all project ownership was taken away from me and given to someone else so they could ""manage my communication."" I wear hearing aids and can lip read. All I needed was people to face me and talk one at a time, but they refused to do that and cut me out instead. I was told that as long as my ""verbal communication problems"" persisted, I would never be promoted again.  The only non-white member of my team had his computer hacked into by our mutual manager so the manager could send e-mails out from that person's computer when that person wasn't there, and effectively managed to destroy his e-mail credibility to the point where when the guy sent out an ""I quit!"" e-mail, no one at first believed him. Then the manager joked with someone else that I hadn't acted up enough for him to do that to me yet. I complained to HR about the whole incident, but nothing happened.  Those involved got away with everything, and are still at the company. HR said they saw no problems with any of this behavior.",Take discrimination seriously!

This in turn can rub off on you and enable you to raise your game, at a cost.","Amazon has the most selfish, individualistic culture of any business I have worked for. The working environment in Slough is down right unpleasant, over-cramped and dirty offices based in a down at heel area of town. The brand name is clearly able to attract some very smart people all hoping to get on the gravy train, but as the business has grown, the culture has become less friendly. Tenured employees are not appreciated and employees in general are entirely disposable. I have never worked with so many people that will happily stab each other in the back (or front) to get ahead. There is no fostering of team spirit or taking a genuine interest in people. No-one seems to have any life outside of work or take any interest in each other as individuals. There is absolutely no investment in talent management, talent development, or CSR. I find this unbelievable in a company the size of Amazon. The HR department contains the most useless group of individuals I have encountered, who seem to do little more than help manage people out of the business.  To survive at Amazon (and that is what you'll do... survive) you have to become an unquestioning drone, happy to work all the hours and meet all the demands on earth without reward or positive feedback. I find it hilarious the one of the leadership principles is 'disagree and commit', however doing so will get your card marked. I also find it hilarious that one of Amazon's 'peculiar ways' (of which there are many), is too not come across like the corporate borg. This place is more like the corporate borg than anywhere I have worked. Regimented leadership principles that you have to adhere to. Don't let wearing casual clothes to work fool you that you'll be playing table football in your lunch hour. 1. You wont get a lunch hour because the business is too frugal (tight) to hire enough staff. 2. There is nowhere to eat your lunch other than your desk, because the deli handling nine floors of employees is tiny. 3. Should you be able to get out for lunch, you have the delights of Slough high street to contend with.  I think the thing that is most depressing, is that the business is doing extremely well in these uncertain times, and yet there is no celebration of this, no lightheartedness, no fun. Just a relentless drive for growth with people under ridiculous amounts of pressure, trampling over each other to get ahead and sticking to cliques in order to survive. It's depressing that people have to act in such a selfish manner to succeed, and depressing to think that you have to abandon your principles to stay afloat..  It is easy to get sucked into the business and try and meet the ridiculous expectations and pressure you will be placed under, but the business can suck you dry if you let it, and spit you out without a thought.

Customers and partners alike are excited about Microsoft technology again and that is exciting to see.","In my opinion, morale is now pretty poor mainly due to the abundance of unnecessary admin/processes, internal politics and poor management. There have been more than a few layoffs (wrapped into ""re-orgs"") in recent years and the practice of stack ranking employees has continued, although mgmt attempted to obscure this by calling it something else (b/c of the negative press following the Vanity Fair article about 5yrs ago).  For years now it seems that numbers have been set at unattainable levels so that most don't make their numbers. This started during the K.T. era (former COO), presumably to cut payout costs, but it has continued after his departure. If I recall, it started after the company announced an across the board raise in base salaries (apparently in response to 'employee feedback about too much compensation being tied to stock').  From that point growth targets seemed to get crazy and a lot of good people left. You'd have one good year but 2 bad ones. Mgmt might change quota or revenue recognition rules mid year and there's nothing you can do about it, or worse yet, you may not find out there was a rule change until the end of the fiscal when you're trying to figure out why your attainment number is off. Incentive plans are so complex that you need a PhD to comprehend. Reporting tools are often broken and you may not be able to accurately track progress against goal, so you may get screwed if you have a manager with few scruples or if you have a mgr looking for a sacrificial lamb for the bottom of the stack ranking.","1. Put in an end to the unrealistic numbers. You'll have a better shot at retaining top talent. 2. Provide a reporting system that works. 3. Reduce the number of re-orgs. 4. Truly bring an end to stack ranking. Don't just call it something else. Stack ranking doesn't breed better employees or even better quality work, it encourages politics and back stabbing which often prompts good people to leave.",3,3,2,3,3,2,0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Microsoft-Reviews-E1651_P261.htm

It has gotten more and more corporate and more and more dehumanizing focusing more on policies and proceedures than the wellbeing of the employees. The daily foot traffic in the store is immense! The climate can be very emotionally overwhelming, loud, and overly stimulating...yeah you are probably thinking I am some sensitive shmuck! But the daily traffic gets overwhelming when you are responsible for dealing with angry customers daily in an environment where you have little support! Managers are inconsistent in implementing company policy, constantly making exceptions for customers who scream and disrespect employees. THERE IS NEVER ENOUGH EMPLOYEES ON THE FLOOR!! BUT MANAGEMENT EXPECTS US TO HELP 4-6 PEOPLE AT ONCE TO MAKE UP FOR IT. LASTLY, moving up in the company is extremely difficult! there are many lateral promotions that warrant no pay raise, but managers are extremely inconsistent in their reasoning for promoting people. You could have perfect numbers and attendence but they will give the promotion to someone who has worse numbers but just sucks up to them more and they will give you a lame reason such as ""we think you need to work on your peer to peer relationships"" (happened to several of my co-workers) THERE ARE NO REAL BEARRINGS FOR PROMOTIONS. AND MOST ""PROMOTIONS"" ARE LATERAL AND ALLOW YOU TO WORK HARDER AND DO MORE IN THE STORE WITHOUT GETTING PAID A CENT MORE...THEY HAVE A REALLY WONDERFUL WAY OF TRICKING YOU INTO FEELING LIKE YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL AND HAPPY THEY GRANTED YOU WITH THIS OPORTUNITY!!! AND THEN DURING THE REVIEW THEY WILL COMMENT ON HOW YOU DON'T SMILE ENOUGH IN YOUR NEW ROLE AND THEY ARE WORRIED YOU ARE GETTING BURNED OUT................AFTER GETTING YELLED AT BY A CUSTOMER EVER HOUR THAT DOESNT WANT TO OBIDE BY THE COMPANY POLICY, AND THEN AFTER THAT CUSTOMER SCREAMS AT YOU AND DEMANDS A MANAGER THE MANAGER GIVES THEM EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT! MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE THE BAD GUY WHEN THEY TOLD YOU TO UPHOLD COMPANY POLICY! IT CAN BE HARD TO KEEP SMILING! BUT WHEN AN EMPLOYEE NEEDS AN EXCEPTION MADE FOR THEM???OOOOHHHH NOOOOO....THE POLICY IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT THEN!!! They say they want to give you more personal development training time but you have to FIGHT for it!  ONE MORE THING! The corporate availability requirements! you are forced to give 29 hours of open availability and they can ether give you 5 hours a week or the full 29....you cannot request to work more or less. THEY ARE SEVERELY INCONSIDERATE AND UNFLEXIBLE ABOUT PERSONAL AND FAMILY EMERGENCIES! IF YOUR GRANDMA DIES AND YOU CANT GET YOUR SHIFT COVERED IN TIME OH WELL! YOU WILL RECIEVE AN ATTENDENCE POINT EVEN IF YOU NOTIFIY THEM A WEEK IN ADVANCE! EVERYTHING IS DONE BY A COMPUTER...ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT HAS OVERRIDING POWERS THEY WILL SELDOM MAKE EXCEPTIONS AND JUST SAY ""SORRY THE COMPUTER ALREADY SCHEDULED YOU...I HOPE YOU FIGURE SOMETHING OUT!""","Read above. YOUR SOUL IS NO LONGER YOUR PEOPLE! As much as I loved your company and invested 3 years of my life to it, my last day was the best day of my life. You must find a way to maintain the appointment queue at the genius bar and lessen the stress on the FRS role. You must find a way to be solid as a management team and have a joint agreement about when to make exceptions. If a coach has a team and teaches the team to obide by certain philosophies, such as: good conduct at every game...but when team players dont follow the rules, no consequence is given...the team loses integrity and later down the line the coaches philosophies will mean nothing to its students because they all know the philosophy was never upheld or valued.

0.226540902138729,amazon,none," Jun 24, 2015",Former Employee - Human Resources,Deciding to Work for Amazon was a Huge Mistake - HR at Amazon Fulfillment Centers is Not HR,"Absolutely zero ""pros"" in my experience at Amazon.","First of all, Amazon recruiters will give you a very inaccurate, over-glossed, rosy picture of HR opportunities at an Amazon Fulfillment Center (FC). They will almost resort to sleazy, car salesman types of tactics to sell you the job. It is very common for experienced HR professionals to come here and share their sentiment of complete shock and awe upon realizing what the true day-to-day job entails. For many of these individuals, the decision to take the position quickly becomes a regret and a mistake. The real day-to-day ground zero experience for HR at an Amazon FC is highly dysfunctional, disorganized, chaotic, and surprisingly embryonic. This is not what constitutes work for the field of HR. Forget strategic HR business partnership, this doesn't exist in the slightest and the company has a long road before HR at Amazon FCs can reach that state. HR at Amazon FCs is purely transactional, secretarial, administrative, low-scope, and demeaning. HR Assistants are doing administrative assistant work, HR Business Partners are doing HR Assistant work, HR Managers are doing HR Generalist and HR Assistant work, and so on. Your time is spent here putting out fires and reacting. There is also a very high volume of low-scope investigation and employee relations issues work. Also, be ready to get buried in hundreds of emails per day and thousands of emails per week. This is not an exaggeration. I barely see any hint of work that is planful or proactive.  Then on top of this, when there are widespread performance problems from other members of the HR team, it exacerbates this condition even more. I question some of the hiring decisions that are made and some of these entry-level HR Assistants that are brought on. It is not uncommon to find yourself surrounded by an excessive degree of professional immaturity. It is not easy to formally address performance and carry out performance management for problem-performing HR team members due to lack of support from leadership. This ties in to the culture overall at Amazon FCs that is too employee-friendly leaving around long leashes instead of placing firm accountability for someone’s performance. I also question the true effectiveness of some of the senior HR leaders in the Amazon FC HR world. There is a high amount of volatility and instability for HR teams at Amazon FCs. New buildings are opening up without the main HR leader position being filled which leads to a lot of other downstream consequences. There is an extremely high amount of negative turnover amongst HRBPs and HRAs (as high as 50% or more). Many who join leave within the first year. The repeated job postings that you see posted that seem to be on an “evergreen” state is not all due to growth and the addition of new positions, a lot of this is to backfill and to recoup from all the turnover that exists. The strong individuals leave on their own volition yet the problem performers stick around for too long. With these conditions, it is truly difficult for one to be set up for success here as an HR professional. The recruiters do a very poor job of presenting a more balanced picture of the job.  Work schedules for HR professionals at Amazon FCs are also not a positive point to highlight. You do get made aware that the HR operation is “24/7” and that you aren’t going to be working the traditional M-F 8-5 job but there are still nuances of work schedule requirements that leaves you feeling imprisoned. You almost feel like you are working an hourly, mall job and are stuck in a specific work schedule without a lot of the flexibility and latitude that you would see for other senior-level HR positions. The company is always in reactive mode so there are a lot of last-minute decisions that get made which affect your work schedule and thereby affect your personal life. Also know that during the Peak season, you will be working a 6x10 schedule in HR doing the low-scope work I described above. This does not get shared with you from the recruiters. What also doesn’t get shared from the recruiters is that you may start out on one specific work schedule (i.e. Days) but it’s common that HR team members will rotate through schedules 1-2x per year so even though you start on Days, you may be on Nights before the year is over. The recruiter didn’t share that variability up front.  I also noticed concerns with the leadership culture at Amazon. The Leadership Principles seem to exist in theory only but not applied in the real world. Many managers tend to be aloof and do not know what it’s really like to develop a true, meaningful work partnership. It is not uncommon to walk by another manager and not receive the slightest hint of acknowledgement, any eye contact, the slightest smile, or a “hi, how are you?”. There is a lot of this type of aloofness going around in multiple buildings. I question the excessive degree to which the organization is employee-friendly as it puts a damper on management being able to effectively run operations and leads to entitled, untactful employees running the show.  Don’t be fooled by the glossy picture painted by the recruiters and the shiny job offer package with high compensation, generous sign-on bonus, and unprecedented stock options. It’s just the strategy to attract and retain talent but then you get in and see how things really are. Think long and hard about your decision before it becomes a decision that you may likely regret significantly after.",Give a fair chance to innocent candidates and be more truthful and accurate about what the career opportunity is like.

0.000858478886672,google,"Mountain View, CA"," Feb 21, 2017",Former Employee - Learning and Development,A Disappointing Place where Bias Still Exists and No true support for those with Disabilities,It is a place that will truly challenge you and there are some great people who are trying to make a true difference. I leave knowing that what I worked on had true impact on others personally and professionally. I was lucky to have the mentors and champions I did.,"It is a sink or swim environment. Wonderful perks but they are there to keep you at work longer. People don't leave jobs, they leave managers. Google has a long way to go when it comes to training their managers effectively and actually making sure they represent the initiatives Google is in the news for such as Psychological Safety and Unconscious Bias. I went from amazing managers and sponsors to the worst manager ever. Just because a manager takes a course doesn't mean they have adopted the lessons taught.  I suffer from a disability that is episodic and goes into remission at times. At the end of my time with Google, despite needs for accommodations due to my disability, my manager declined a request to work in a quieter and more private work space. HR took their time. In addition, I was only allowed to work from home on Fridays. I was also penalized on my performance review for not being able to work in a more visible work space. This is important to note. I went from a high performing employee for 4+ years and then got sick and within 3-4months was rated as a Needs Improvement by my manager who had only managed me for 3 months and the one before 5 months. At Google, your MANAGER has the final say on your performance review. Despite high ratings from everyone else, HR stands firm about letting the managers rating be the overall rating and override all other reviewers.  Google needs to understand that not all people work or learn the same way. Don't expect reasonable accommodations to be honored here. They took 6 weeks to respond to my drs note for a medically necessary accommodation. This is NOT a space if you have any type of disability especially cognitive or mental ones. There is a whole internal email disability group which provides a community for many of us who are struggle from our disability and not our jobs. However, no one from HR has bothered to address the true struggles that people with disabilities are facing.","It is not enough to just have programs on Psychological Safety and Unconscious Bias. Google needs to do a better job vetting and deciding who moves into a management role. I loved my job and I was great at it. The change to two new managers in less than 6 months was not only too much for me to take but for our team of 10. Manager survey reports are enough. What are the chances that the managers report is going to tell you that the managers you put in place last lacked so little empathy, compassion, and support and was so goal driven that they pushed 2 of their 10 reports onto medical leave. Google, you are losing tons of top talent because people don't fit into a particular mold. The truth of the matter is that sooooo much top talent can be saved with very minor accommodations. There needs to be an Advocate for those who have disabilities to mediate with HR or managers when needed. So many managers are caught up in their day to day that despite being educated on Unconscious Bias .... they just can't see their biases because they are so caught up on performance. You can't know what you don't know just like many of these managers can't see their biases. You can't see what you can't see and a short workshop or online course is not enough to make you see it, identify it and change it. Google, you need someone to be identifying and challenging managers in real life to challenge their biases and to come in and advocate for those with disabilities. Many other companies already have this role and it is truly unfortunate that a large company such as Google at the forefront of so much does not.  ""Many of us, particularly those of us with disabilities who have faced persistent discrimination throughout our lives, not least when trying to find employment in the first place, take enormous pride in our hard-fought jobs and careers.""- Stella Young. For many with disabilities, it is a dream come true to work at Google. It's hard to work so hard with a disability, and have your accomplishments taken away not because of your disability, but because of persistent discrimination.",2,1,2,2,4,2,10,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Google-Reviews-E9079_P151.htm
